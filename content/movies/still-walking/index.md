Stripped of plot twists and dramatic expectations set in Hollywood, simplicity drives the beauty of Still Walking.

To commemorate the death of their brother Junpei, Ryota and Chinami visit their parents' home in Yokohama. Chinami is accompanied by her husband and two kids, while Ryota comes with his wife Yukari and her child Atsushi. Ryota recently married Yukari, whose previous husband passed away, to his parents Kyohei and Toshiko's dismay. Importantly, Atsushi is the child of Yukari's previous marriage, and not the child of Ryota and Yukari.

As grief and regret bubble through the day, Koreeda begins to reveal the small but significant frustrations that each character has. Kyohei grieves for Junpei, who was destined to continue his family clinic and bring honor to the family. While he hoped Ryota would take his place, Ryota instead decided to work in art restoration and is between jobs. Toshiko wishes that Ryota had married a different woman, instead of a woman who's been in a previous relationship. And Yukari wishes throughout the whole day that the Yokoyama family would just treat Atsushi like family, not a guest.

But these tensions rarely come to light. The movie is filled with scenes where the family just acts like a family: eating together, asking for recipes, gossipping about other people. The only glimpses we get into what each person really thinks are in small, isolated scenes, like the small moments of silence or the interactions between a few, specific characters. Otherwise, when the family is together, each of the characters demonstrate restraint in an incredibly Japanese yet universal fashion. Ryota lies about having work to the family to make sure he doesn't disappoint his father. Yukari keeps an incredibly positive, outgoing, and helpful attitude in attempt to gain the family's favor.

It's through these interactions that we can see Koreeda'
