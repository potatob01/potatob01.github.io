Hey! I'm Joshua, a junior at Troy High School. As of recent, I've been finding myself in cybersecurity, math, music, and my school's NJROTC unit. Here's a quick breakdown:

# Cybersecurity

While I've always found myself around computers since I was young, it wasn't until I entered 8th grade that I was introduced to the topic through [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org), a nationwide competition for middle and high schoolers run by the Air & Space Forces Administration. I'm the team captain of Runtime Terror, a CyberPatriot team that's gone to the national finals round (the top 12 out of a couple thousand teams!) every year since our inception in 2021. I've personally been to the national finals twice so far, which take the format of an RvB with some amusing topologies. Each nationals I've been to have been incredibly eye-opening, stress-inducing, and thrilling experiences that keep my love for cybersecurity going strong.
