        <title>Still Walking (2008)</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/movies/still-walking/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Still Walking (2008)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripped of plot twists and dramatic expectations set in Hollywood, simplicity drives the beauty of Still Walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To commemorate the death of their brother Junpei, Ryota and Chinami visit their parents&amp;rsquo; home in Yokohama. Chinami is accompanied by her husband and two kids, while Ryota comes with his wife Yukari and her child Atsushi. Ryota recently married Yukari, whose previous husband passed away, to his parents Kyohei and Toshiko&amp;rsquo;s dismay. Importantly, Atsushi is the child of Yukari&amp;rsquo;s previous marriage, and not the child of Ryota and Yukari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As grief and regret bubble through the day, Koreeda begins to reveal the small but significant frustrations that each character has. Kyohei grieves for Junpei, who was destined to continue his family clinic and bring honor to the family. While he hoped Ryota would take his place, Ryota instead decided to work in art restoration and is between jobs. Toshiko wishes that Ryota had married a different woman, instead of a woman who&amp;rsquo;s been in a previous relationship. And Yukari wishes throughout the whole day that the Yokoyama family would just treat Atsushi like family, not a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these tensions rarely come to light. The movie is filled with scenes where the family just acts like a family: eating together, asking for recipes, gossipping about other people. The only glimpses we get into what each person really thinks are in small, isolated scenes, like the small moments of silence or the interactions between a few, specific characters. Otherwise, when the family is together, each of the characters demonstrate restraint in an incredibly Japanese yet universal fashion. Ryota lies about having work to the family to make sure he doesn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint his father. Yukari keeps an incredibly positive, outgoing, and helpful attitude in attempt to gain the family&amp;rsquo;s favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s through these interactions that we can see Koreeda&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Joshua, an incoming junior at Troy High School. As of recent, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding myself in cybersecurity, math, music, and my school&amp;rsquo;s NJROTC unit. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cybersecurity&#34;&gt;Cybersecurity
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve always found myself around computers since I was young, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I entered 8th grade that I was introduced to the topic through &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uscyberpatriot.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CyberPatriot&lt;/a&gt;, a nationwide competition for middle and high schoolers run by the Air &amp;amp; Space Forces Administration. I&amp;rsquo;m the team captain of Runtime Terror, a CyberPatriot team that&amp;rsquo;s gone to the national finals (the top 12 out of thousands of teams!) every year since our inception in 2021. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally been to nationals twice so far, which take the format of an RvB with some amusing network topologies. Each trip to nationals has been incredibly eye-opening, stress-inducing, and thrilling experiences that keep my love for cybersecurity going strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;My passion for math is really driven by a deep love for logical thinking and problem-solving. It just happens that these skills manifest themselves most clearly through math olympiads. I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in the AMC competitions since the seventh grade, and have qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) twice so far. You can also find me at various local math competitions in my area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family is deep into music. Everyone on my mom&amp;rsquo;s side of the family are musicians, and my dad grew up listening and playing lots of music. So whether it&amp;rsquo;s from the environment I grew up in or genetics, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I also have a blooming interest in music. I personally play the piano, which has been a part of my life for the better part of the last five years. You might also be able to find covers that I&amp;rsquo;ve made of some songs floating &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;njrotc&#34;&gt;NJROTC
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troy has one of the biggest JROTC units in the country. As such, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself forging some of my closest friendships in the unit and found a strong sense of &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; there. As one of the current color guard division heads, I&amp;rsquo;ve stepped into a leadership position for the incoming year, renewing my excitement for JROTC and opening new doors for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;everything-else&#34;&gt;Everything else!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a quick a rundown of my academics. But what makes me &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just a couple things I like to do in my free time (a constantly updating list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching movies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play puzzle games with my friends (OK &amp;amp; KL, my goats)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for a drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on felicity (my Linux script), my one and only true love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work out at the gym&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
