        <title>KPop Demon Hunters</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://joshuak.im/movies/kpop-demon-hunters/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post KPop Demon Hunters" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the actual movie, can we talk about that name? Like, I get that it&amp;rsquo;s probably hard to think of a title for a movie like this. But KPop Demon Hunters could not have been the best choice. It just makes the movie feel so much more childish than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it into a few words, the movie exceeded my expectations. By a lot. You go into the movie expecting it to be a kids movie – one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have actual themes and complex characters like this movie has. You definitely don&amp;rsquo;t expect scenes like the ones where Rumi asks Celine (who was essentially her mother) to kill her with her own sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumi&amp;rsquo;s character development throughout the movie is shockingly well-made. The frustration she feels about her patterns and identity parallel similar conflicts that people have in life. Her friendship with Zoey and Mira just feels so real – with the overwhelming support she gets and the frustrations she has with each of them. And her conflict with Jinu dances so satisfyingly along that edge between enemies and lovers throughout the whole movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation is also pretty good, especially for a film that was never intended for release in theaters. Being animated by Sony, who&amp;rsquo;s been pretty busy breaking their back carrying Western animation for the past decade or so, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the scenes look beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest part for me was how prominent Korean culture was in the movie. Although it is an American film, the background in every scene captures the essence of Korea so well, and there&amp;rsquo;s just enough of the culture mixed in for it to feel normal for foreign fans, but authentic for Korean fans as well. Especially through their choice of voice actors and singers, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that Netflix put in effort to make the film feel convincingly Korean. Getting well-known actors like Ahn Hyo-seop, Lee Byung-hun, and especially getting Twice to cover Takedown, definitely gets the film some cookie points in the Korean department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I would have liked to see a little more of the other characters though. We only got a few lines from every Saja Boy apart from Jinu, and Zoey and Mira just felt like side characters purely created to highlight Rumi. While I get that HUNTR/X was formed around Rumi, the movie really doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother to give Zoey and Mira much backstory at all. And we know almost nothing about the other Saja Boys. I guess we know one of them has abs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, I came out of the movie with vastly different thoughts than I came into it with. The movie had real emotional weight, with jokes that were actually funny, and sad scenes that were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; sad, not just &amp;ldquo;womp womp&amp;rdquo; sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the music slaps. The music is super catchy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Magdalene Ho and Competition in Music</title>
        <link>https://joshuak.im/blog/magdalene-ho/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 00:52:00 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://joshuak.im/blog/magdalene-ho/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://joshuak.im/blog/magdalene-ho/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Magdalene Ho and Competition in Music" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently had the chance to see the final round of the XVII Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. It was an incredible experience being able to listen to so much skill and music each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the competition, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard something about Magdalene Ho, a 21-year-old competitor born in California and raised in Malaysia. She caught the public&amp;rsquo;s eye with her preliminary round recital, where she gave a particularly stunning rendition of Franck&amp;rsquo;s Prélude, Choral et Fugue. (Side note: 6 players have performed this piece before Magdalene in the Cliburn, yet none of them have advanced.) Between forums like Reddit and discussions among notable critics in the industry, the support for her was immense, with some people vowing to root for her till the end. But as the quarterfinalists were announced on May 23, people were shocked to find her name absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been pretty involved in music since youth, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of competitions from local to international levels. And regardless of the scope and level of competition, it seems to be too often that I see results that really make me think, &amp;ldquo;Hm?&amp;rdquo;. Sometimes I see the results posted and I don&amp;rsquo;t see the name of someone I expected to be up there, or sometimes I see someone up there that I really hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected to place. But at the local level (and especially with particularly egregious injustices), it&amp;rsquo;s easy to chalk it up to some questionable judges. There are simply too many competitions that I go to that have only one judge that actually plays the instrument that&amp;rsquo;s being judged, sometimes with a questionable amount of credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But competitions like the Cliburn? They have large juries with extremely distinguished pianists. Every judge has a distinguished history in piano, with one member even winning the Cliburn himself back in 1997. The jury surely made very well-thought-out and well-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, music is an art – a form of expression. While musicians are obliged to stay within the lines of what the composer left for them, there&amp;rsquo;s so much individuality and freedom for musicians to express inside that box. At smaller-scale competitions, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to say someone is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; for something, purely because competitors often have varying levels of foundational technique and understanding. But at these international competitions, where everyone has good technique and a solid foundation, it&amp;rsquo;s really just up to how convincingly musicians can portray their interpretation. And that&amp;rsquo;s always subjective. Just look at Ivo Pogorelich from the 1980 Chopin Competition, where Argerich removed herself from the jury after he was cut in the third round. Pogorelich got the very highest score from half the jury and the very lowest score from the other half. It&amp;rsquo;s just too easy for a jury member to go, &amp;ldquo;I really agree with how this person played this&amp;rdquo;, or to go &amp;ldquo;I think this interpretation is completely distasteful&amp;rdquo;. The jury members are humans with their own opinions after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to argue that there is an inherent flaw to music competitions. But they should keep going. In a world like the one of classical music, getting your name out there is so difficult. Think of the number of people you know that play an instrument seriously, and compare that to the number of classical musicians you can name. Making a living in this life is hard. And winning a major competition can (key word: can) be the golden ticket to someone&amp;rsquo;s music career. Pollini, Argerich, and Zimerman all won the Chopin Competition early on in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is a young, aspiring musician should never think of competitions as the only ticket. Because ultimately, you know who the jury is? Us. The public. Wooing the hearts of the public will always be the cornerstone of an effective career, not wooing the hearts of a competition jury.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Still Walking (2008)</title>
        <link>https://joshuak.im/movies/still-walking/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 01:41:25 -0700</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://joshuak.im/movies/still-walking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://joshuak.im/movies/still-walking/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Still Walking (2008)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripped of plot twists and Hollywood-esque drama, simplicity drives the beauty of Still Walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a little over 24 hours, Still Walking follows the Yokoyama family&amp;rsquo;s memorial for their eldest son Junpei. The parents, Kyohei and Toshiko Yokoyama, host their two remaining children Ryota and Chinami at their house for the day. Junpei&amp;rsquo;s death was particularly difficult for the parents, as he was the favorite of the three and was destined to continue the family clinic, the lifelong pride of his father Kyohei. While Kyohei had some hope left for Ryota, Ryota instead became an art restorer and is often between jobs, which the father is still conflicted over. To make matters worse, Ryota married Yukari, a widow with a son from her previous marriage, a marriage that both parents (especially his mother) still haven&amp;rsquo;t accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;family&#34;&gt;Family
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones with gripes: there&amp;rsquo;s tension between everyone in the family. Ryota&amp;rsquo;s stepson refuses to call him &amp;ldquo;dad&amp;rdquo;, struggling to understand how Ryota fits in his own family. Toshiko, with her signature passive-aggressiveness, wants Ryota to have a son of his own. And crucially, Yukari just wants the Yokoyama family to treat Atsushi as their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s never confrontation in the family. Through their gripes, the family just acts like a family: eating together, asking for recipes, gossiping about other people. The only glimpses we get into what each person really thinks are in small, isolated scenes – scenes where the family isn&amp;rsquo;t together. Otherwise, when the family is together, each of the characters demonstrate restraint in both a uniquely Japanese way and a universally understandable fashion. Ryota does his best to keep talking with his dad, and calms his worries by pretending he has a job. Toshiko keeps conversation with Yukari, who is extremely good-spirited and kind, with Toshiko even gifting her a kimono at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s really what makes family. The love is never perfect – expectations feel too high, and there&amp;rsquo;s never a perfect understanding between everyone. But there&amp;rsquo;s an everlasting link that brings them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;grief&#34;&gt;Grief
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Yoshio shows up – the fat, unemployed, and &amp;ldquo;loser&amp;rdquo;-like classmate that Junpei died saving – Toshiko feels incredible grief thinking that her son&amp;rsquo;s life was lost for a man like him. In an incredibly powerful scene where Ryota asks why the family still invites him after fifteen years, Toshiko states, &amp;ldquo;Not having someone to hate makes it all the worse for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in the day, Toshiko asks Ryota about the name of a sumo wrestler that she can&amp;rsquo;t seem to remember. He can&amp;rsquo;t seem to remember either, which bugs her for the rest of the day. As Ryota leaves the town and the bus departs, he remembers the name, remarking, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s always like that, I&amp;rsquo;m always a little late.&amp;rdquo; That was the last day that Ryota saw his parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the very end of the film, through a voiceover, Ryota tells us that he never got to watch a soccer game with his dad, or give his mom a ride in a car – something that his parents always wished to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only human nature to miss opportunities: opportunities to forgive, opportunities to love. Written in thoughts of his own late mother, Kore-eda surely understands this well. And while there is a &amp;ldquo;life is fleeting&amp;rdquo; message to be said, it&amp;rsquo;s really about grief. The inevitability of lingering grief in the cycle of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-thoughts&#34;&gt;My thoughts!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kore-eda&amp;rsquo;s orchestration of all these different scenes is nothing short of masterful. The characters seem so genuine and the scenes so real that you feel like you&amp;rsquo;ve just been plopped in the Yokoyama home for a day. It&amp;rsquo;s really the small details (which there are SO many of) that give the film such a profound feeling, something that has always been Kore-eda&amp;rsquo;s strong suit. Throughout the entire two hours of the film, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a single second is wasted – every scene has weight and importance in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also an incredibly attractive style that the movie has when the plot is driven by these small details rather than action or plot twists. It&amp;rsquo;s helped by the actors, who really excel in their roles. Kirin Kiki, playing the role of Toshiko, creates a perfect persona for the calm yet snide person that Toshiko is. The child actor for Atsushi, Shohei Tanaka, is incredible in creating a nuanced, complicated character while still feeling just like a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, the film isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. The subtlety definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone – Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly calls it &amp;ldquo;fetishistic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;a tad frustrating&amp;rdquo;, which is understandable considering the extremely different approach that Kore-eda loves to take. But the power behind Kore-eda&amp;rsquo;s ability to convey emotion is not to be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Joshua, an incoming junior at Troy High School. As of recent, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding myself in cybersecurity, math, music, and my school&amp;rsquo;s NJROTC unit. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cybersecurity&#34;&gt;Cybersecurity
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve always found myself around computers since I was young, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I entered 8th grade that I was introduced to the topic through &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.uscyberpatriot.org&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CyberPatriot&lt;/a&gt;, a nationwide competition for middle and high schoolers run by the Air &amp;amp; Space Forces Administration. I&amp;rsquo;m the team captain of Runtime Terror, a CyberPatriot team that&amp;rsquo;s gone to the national finals (the top 12 out of thousands of teams!) every year since our inception in 2021. I&amp;rsquo;ve personally been to nationals twice so far, which take the format of an RvB with some amusing network topologies. Each trip to nationals has been incredibly eye-opening, stress-inducing, and thrilling experiences that keep my love for cybersecurity going strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;My passion for math is really driven by a deep love for logical thinking and problem-solving. It just happens that these skills manifest themselves most clearly through math olympiads. I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in the AMC competitions since the seventh grade, and have qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) twice so far. You can also find me at various local math competitions in my area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family is deep into music. Everyone on my mom&amp;rsquo;s side of the family are musicians, and my dad grew up listening and playing lots of music. So whether it&amp;rsquo;s from the environment I grew up in or genetics, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I also have a blooming interest in music. I personally play the piano, which has been a part of my life for the better part of the last five years. But I loooove singing in my free time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;njrotc&#34;&gt;NJROTC
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troy has one of the biggest JROTC units in the country. As such, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself forging some of my closest friendships in the unit and found a strong sense of &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; there. As one of the current color guard division heads, I&amp;rsquo;ve stepped into a leadership position for the incoming year, renewing my excitement for JROTC and opening new doors for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;everything-else&#34;&gt;Everything else!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a quick a rundown of my academics. But what makes me &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just a couple things I like to do in my free time (a constantly updating list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching movies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play puzzle games with my friends (OK &amp;amp; KL, my goats)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karaoke!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on felicity (my Linux script), my one and only true love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work out at the gym&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
